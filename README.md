# Portfolio

This is the project with which I am completing my React course in SoftUni. In it I describe the programming skills I possess and present my most successful projects. It includes both a Front-End part that I built using React, HTML and CSS, and a Back-End part that I wrote on node.js and express, and for encrypting the admin passwords I used bcrypt. The DataBases I worked with are Mongodb Atlas.
